Nowadays a blog is a typical thing to have. And as a digital nomad, it is an easy way to keep everyone up to date. So <a href="https://www.immerguteswetter.de" target="_blank">ImmerGutesWetter</a> is my way of communicating with the folks back home but also a kind of travel diary and a platform to work on my programming skills.

<h4>The Idea</h4>

The main thing for a blog is, of course, the blog itself. Besides this main feature, there are some other things you want to communicate. In this case, I wanted to show a feat with our newest Instagram pictures and some information about us, for people that stumble upon the blog without knowing us.
So the website consists of a blog, an about-site, an Instagram feed and to sum it up, a start side wich gives you the newest blog posts and some initial information.

<h4>The Design</h4>

Simple and easy where most important but also fun, nice to look at and recognizable. So I landed on a fun start side and a clean and easy design for the other pages. 
The start side gives you an overview and an idea what it is all about without having to read anything. 
The design is clean and easy to use (so even my grandma can navigate without any problems).

</div> -->


<h4>The Footer</h4>

One unique feature is the footer on the start side. Depending on the location I am at the footer changes. From a mountain scenery to a beach view to a city skyline.

<h4>The Result</h4>

You can see and use the website yourself on <a href="www.immerguteswetter.de">ImmerGutesWetter</a>. I really like what it looks like and am proud to have designed and built it myself. And yes, it is and always will be a playground for me to experiment.
