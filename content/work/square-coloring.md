I love to color. I always use the opportunity to color with a child in their coloring book (of course only if invited to do so).

In recent years more and more coloring books for adults became available and are a great pleasure for interested parties.

Most coloring books for adults are fantastic, well thought and executed pictures. You can get everything from mandalas to dream worlds and princesses. But for the more square minded person, these options are much to dreamy. So I decided to make a coloring book, entirely made out of squares. For the people that like to box stuff and sometimes think out of the box.

<h4>The Outside</h4>

Of course, the format of the book is a square. To be exact, it is 21 x 21 cm. And as you see, the squares start here. The Cover design is also available inside the book for you to be creative with it.

<h4>The Inside</h4>

Inside the book, you find 50 pages, filled with squares. And as you may find, squares aren't that boring. In fact, there are some pretty amazing things you can do with simple things such as squares. Maybe there is a life lesson to be found. But it's best to see for yourself. Here are some examples.

<h4>Where To Buy It</h4>

As you may have guessed, you can buy the book on Amazon. At the moment there is a German version available. But I think it will be okay if you color in a different language :)
Here is the link to <a href="http://amzn.to/2y12R12">amazon.de</a> and here to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Das-Quadrate-Malbuch-Erwachsene-Anderen/dp/1975974611/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505395354&sr=8-1&keywords=quadrate+malbuch">amazon.com</a>. And yes, this is an affiliate link. So if you don't want to klick it just put "Das Quadrate Malbuch" into the searchbar on amazon.

<h4>What do you think?</h4>
