While traveling the world as a digital nomad, I have the opportunity to meet a lot of people and to get to know different cultures and lifestyles.

I also use the time to figure out some stuff about myself. And because I found out that I am not the only one struggling with life I started to write about it. 

I used the opportunity to code my first website and learned html and css. 

More or less frequently you can find a post about what I think. Each blog post is accompanied by an illustration. You can find some of them on this side. If you are interested in my thoughts, you are welcome to <a href="https://www.verenaortlieb.com/blog/" target="_blank">read my blog here</a>.

By the way, you can buy some of my illustrations on Society6. Just <a href="https://society6.com/verena_von_o">click here</a> and see if you like something.
