While I travel as a digital nomad, I have the opportunity to meet a lot of people. But besides all the external interactions I also can get to know me and how I feel very well. 

I like to write about the stuff I think about on my blog. The topics vary from problems that digital nomads have to being a human in this world. Each blog post is accompanied by a picture. Here you can find some of them. If you are interested in my thoughts, you are welcome to <a href="https://www.verenaortlieb.com/blog/" target="_blank">read my blog here</a>.
