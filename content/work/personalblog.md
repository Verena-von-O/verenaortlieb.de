The new diary is the blog. You can write down your thoughts and open up to the world. If someone is interested or finds value in it, they can get in touch. That's what I am doing with my personal blog. Besides writing about what I think I offer others the possibility to get in touch and get talking.

It is a clean and straightforward design that focuses on the important thing, namely the content.
