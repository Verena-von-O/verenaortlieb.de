<h4>Meet The Big Red One</h4>

There is always a big one in the group. He’s taller than the others, and from the outside, he looks dangerous. But in reality, he’s the nicest of them all. He always makes sure that everyone is ok. He helps and is there if you need him. Everyone loves him and looks up to him.


<h4>Meet Mister Purple</h4>

Each group has someone who is just a little bit different. Mister Purple is chaotic and lively. He always wants to do something and get on new adventures. He’s excited to discover the woods but also to build massive forts in the living room. He’s fun to be with.


<h4>Meet The Healthy One</h4>

Staying healthy and fit is important. Therefore you have to eat the right food. Not only pizza and ice cream all the time. The green robot reminds everyone of that and keeps the group healthy. But he’s not annoying about it. Not like some people that always tell you what you are doing wrong and that you have to eat more salad. No, he knows really yummy things that are healthy too.


<h4>Meet The Funny One</h4>

Always joking around and always laughing. That’s the funny one. He loves to make everyone smile and having fun. But he also is there for you if you are sad and want to talk serious stuff. He can listen and help you to feel better about yourself. That’s why everyone loves him so much.


<h4>Meet The Toaster</h4>

He’s the smallest but want’s to be one of the big ones. He’s got a really squeaky voice and is always running around to not miss anything. He’s scared that nobody likes him, but in reality, he’s everyone's friend. Because you can count on him and he will help you with everything.


<h4>Meet The Crazy Box</h4>

<img id="robot-schmal" src="/img/RobotBox.png" alt="">

He’s square and organized. He doesn’t like to run around and do all kinds of stuff. He’s the one that watches everyone and keeps them safe. He doesn’t like excitement and tries to plan everything. But when he sees the others having a great time he joins them and really likes it.


<h4>Meet The Blue One</h4>

<img id="robot-schmal" src="/img/RobotBlue.png" alt="">

He’s everyone's best friend. He’s crazy as Mister Purple when they are together but also calm and organized like The Crazy Box when he’s with him. He also can settle arguments between the others because he understands everyone and can find common ground. Or another idea what to do that is even more awesome.
