As a designer, it is necessary to have some kind of portfolio to show some of your work. And because I don't only design stuff but also know how to make websites it was the obvious choice to build a portfolio website.

<div class="img-portfolio-overview">
	<img src="/img/all-that-stuff.jpg" alt="">
	<img src="/img/nobody-cares.jpg" alt="">
	<img src="/img/imperfect.jpg" alt="">
</div>


<h4>The Idea</h4>

Besides showing some of my work I also can show my coding skills, can add some more information about me and some links to social media profiles of mine.

<div class="img-portfolio-overview">
	<img src="/img/Ice4.png" alt="">
	<img src="/img/PolyStart.png" alt="">
	<img src="/img/RobotStart.png" alt="">
</div>


<h4>The Advantage</h4>

And, a significant advantage of a website as a portfolio instead of a pdf or something like that is, that I can constantly update the site. So sending a link to my website means that you get the newest portfolio every time you klick on the link.

<div class="img-portfolio-overview">
	<img src="/img/StuffPineapple.png" alt="">
	<img src="/img/StuffTetris.png" alt="">
	<img src="/img/StuffCoffee.png" alt="">
</div>

<h4>The End</h4>
