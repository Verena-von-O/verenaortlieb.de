<h1 id="title-my-blog">Recources.</h1>

As I mentioned, there are a lot of great people out there who keep inspiring me and giving me resources to improve myself, my life and help others. Because there are so many inspiring people out there and I keep finding new sources, this collection is just a small but steadily growing selection. 

I hope you like what you find here. If you have any other recommendations or questions, [just let me know](/contact).
