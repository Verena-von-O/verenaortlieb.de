<h1>Hi, I'm Verena!</h1>

I am a nomadic illustrator & designer. 
My current areas of focus are UX Design and Illustrations, through I am open to all illustration-design-oriented inquiries.

I love bringing psychology into the design to make the experience even better. Or just playing around and making some awesome stuff.

Besides design and art, I know my way around HTML & CSS and am married to <a href="https://www.florianbuerger.com" target="_blank">a guy who can code</a>. So all bases covered there.

Want to get in touch? Let's get coffee (or send me <a href="mailto:hello@verenaortlieb.de" target="_blank">an email</a> first).
