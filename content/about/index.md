<h1 id="title-my-blog">About me.</h1>


In 2015, when I finished college, I had to decide how my life would look like from that point forward. I made a conscious choice to do what most people just dream about. **By the summer of 2016, I sold all my belongings and started traveling the world as a digital nomad.**

Soon I realized, that just leaving didn't mean that everything else just magically began to align. There were still problems and questions I had to solve and answer.

**So I started to dive deep into how to figure out what I want and how to get there.**

I love to learn from inspiring people all around the world and use that knowledge to get to know me, my goals and how to build my life in the best possible way.

With all that knowledge and so much more to learn, I decided to start to share it. I started to talk to friends and people I met while traveling about all the different things I was learning. Soon I recognized, that a lot of people find themselves in similar places. Traveling the world but bringing some extra soul-baggage. By talking with them about what Iâ€™ve learned, I was able to help them to see other perspectives, other ways, other ideas.

After a while, I decided to start to write about what I learned and what I am learning still. **I hope by doing so, much more people, especially digital nomads can find what their life should be all about**.

If you want to read more, [enjoy my blog](/blog). If you are stuck and want to talk, have any questions or just want to say hi, [feel free to send me a note](/contact).
