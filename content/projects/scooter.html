<h1>Scooter</h1>
<p class="project-text">Electric Scooters are the new way to travel. At least it was very popular in the summer of 2019. I made some nice illustrations for a new formed scooter company based out of Oslo. These were used for the splash screen of the app as well as the tutorial and some other places in the app.</p>
