**So here you are.** Lying in your hammock on the beach, enjoying your mango shake and watching the waves. You have done it. You put everything you had in your backpack, sold or stored the rest of your stuff, bought a plane ticket and left.

You dared more than most people ever will. You left the “normal”, proven way of life and followed your heart, your soul, your inner adventurer to the other side of the world. **So here you are.**

But instead of just enjoying yourself, your mango shake, the sun, the waves, the world, you can’t stop thinking. You are thinking about how to make money, how to meet people, how to find love, how to get the most of it, what to eat later, what to experience, what not to miss and what and how and all kinds of stuff.

And while your head keeps spinning you realize that you’re laying on the beach with your mango shake, miles away from your past life but your thoughts and worries are still the same. You may have escaped the physical space and the people that didn’t make you happy before, but you brought along the psychological baggage. Huge baggage. Bags and bags full of negative thought and ideas and fears and so on. **So here they are with you.**

Instead of living the dream you live the same life but with a prettier view and better weather. But it’s still the same life. What you realized is, that the problem wasn’t the physical space and the people in the first place, **the problem was you all along.** And guess what, you brought yourself to the new location. New physical space, new people around your, but still you. Still the same thought, fears, and problems just in a different surrounding. 

So what do you do next? One possibility would be to move on. Pack your bag and travel to the next place. Different physical space, different people, different cocktails, different food, different view, different sunset. But guess what. YOU will still be there. Same thoughts, same fears, same problems. **So here you are, again.** 

Maybe, just maybe there is another possibility. Maybe now is the time that you realize, that to find what you were looking for in the world outside, you have to find in yourself. You have to work on yourself, to change yourself, to align yourself, to love yourself, to be yourself to become happier, more fulfilled and be able to fully enjoy your mango shake on the beach without all the haunting thoughts, fears and problems.

Once you have realized that you are the variable that has to change, you can do so. **So that you are truly here.**

**So what's next? Where to go from here?**
First of all, it is a big step to realize what you just realized. And with that in mind, you can start to improve, to create, to make the best out of your life. <!-- **How to do so?** You can start by reading some of my <a href="/blog">blog posts</a>, find some <a href="/resources">inspring resources</a> or <a href="/contact">get in touch with me</a>. -->

**But most important is that you keep exploring, keep being conscious and curious about yourself, your life and where you want to go.**
