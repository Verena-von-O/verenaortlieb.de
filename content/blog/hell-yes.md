Maybe you heard this saying somewhere before. Maybe that’s the first time. Maybe it resonates with you, maybe not. But it’s still worth saying it “If it’s not a hell yes, it’s a no.”

**And it’s worth repeating it in a loud voice: “If it’s not a hell yes, it’s a no.”**

But what does it mean? Sure, it sounds good. It sounds even better when you scream it from the top of your lungs (or in your head) with a big fat smile on your face and your arms raised towards the sky. “If it’s not a hell yes, it’s a no.”

But still, saying or screaming doesn’t get us any closer to the meaning. **So, let’s figure it out.**

Like so many sayings this one can be interpreted in many different ways. And it’s also highly depending on yourself and your circumstances how you understand it and if you even think it’s useful or just bs.

In my opinion, the easiest way to interpret it is to say that if you are confronted with a decision and your answer is “hell yes” from the top of your lungs with a smile on your face and your arms raised towards the sky then it’s the right thing to do. If you aren’t screaming and raising and smiling it’s the wrong thing to do.

**Easy as this. Screaming, smiling, raising means yes, everything else means no.**

And that’s a hell of a way to live your life. Only doing what really excites you what makes you scream and smile from all the joy. And maybe that’s your reality. Maybe you have the luxury to decide based on this great feeling. **Maybe you have enough time to wait for this one thing, that one “hell yes.”**

But that’s not the case for the most of us and certainly not all the time. Maybe there are some big “hell yes” moments every now and then, but other decisions aren’t made to be “hell yes” moments. **Other decisions have to be drawn between these moments, and there will be no screaming or smiling or raising.**

And that’s ok. How boring would it get if every decision would be a “hell yes” moment? We would get used to it and would have to search for something more, something better, to feel that excitement. So maybe it’s good that these moments only come around every so often. **Maybe it’s worth waiting for them and enjoy them once they are there.**

And in the meantime, we can occupy ourselves with all the little moments, all the moments that aren’t “hell yes” but simply “yes” with a smile and a good feeling inside.

Maybe for the small things, a simple “yes” with a smile is enough. **Maybe all these little happy “yes” moments are the way that leads us to the one, the shout and raise and smile “hell yes” moments.** Maybe without the small happy “yes” moments, the big one couldn’t come.
