I love to color. I always use the opportunity to color with a child in their coloring book (of course only if invited to do so).

In recent years more and more coloring books for adults became available and are a great pleasure for interested parties.

Most coloring books for adults are fantastic, well thought and executed pictures. You can get everything from mandalas to dream worlds and princesses. But for the more square minded person, these options are much to dreamy. So I decided to make a coloring book, entirely made out of squares. For the people that like to box stuff and sometimes think out of the box.
