How many goals do you have at the moment? Want to write the book you are thinking about since month? Want to get a new job? Want to do X and Y and all the other letters in the alphabet? 

**We all have goals we want to achieve because there is a magical land waiting on the other side.** As soon as we reach this particular goal we are going to be the person we want to be. We are going to be happy, and everything will be supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (don't you just love this movie?). You just have to reach the goal, and it will happen. Pure magic.

Wouldn't it be nice if this would be true? Or do you still think that life works this way? **Then I am very sorry to have to tell you that your life still will be the same after you have reached your precious goal.** Maybe you will have published a book, or you will have a new job or a new partner in your life. But it still will be the same. Sorry about that. 

**So what would happen if we would stop having goals?** I don't mean to stop to do things and never to accomplish anything. I mean to stop living our life from goal to goal. 

We set a goal, reach it, see that nothing changed, set another goal, reach it ... you see where I'm going with this. Not what we should thrive for.

So what would happen if we would stop having goals like that? **Instead we could have ideas about what we want to do.** We could follow these ideas and see what comes up. Trust that we will find the right thing to do.

So your idea is to publish a book. What to do? Write every day. Get in contact with people that could help you. See if it actually becomes a book in the end or if maybe along the way you start writing a blog and see that this is much better for you. Or you discover that podcasts are what you love to do. Or maybe writing isn't really what you want, and you love to be a baker. Who knows. 

What I mean by not having goals is that you shouldn't define your life by some idea you make into a goal and try to reach. **By trying to achieve this goal you might end up missing what your life is all about.** Maybe you find more pleasure in something entirely different. Maybe it is the thing it was all about from the start. Maybe, maybe, maybe. No matter what it will be in the end don't miss all the exciting new possibilities along the way by trying to stick to your one goal. 

**So maybe when we stop having goals we actually live the life we could never have dreamed of. A life we never would have even imagined while chasing goals we thought we want to reach.**
