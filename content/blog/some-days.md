Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure that everyone had one of these days. One of these days where you just know that it’s not going to be your day. One of these days you just knew that it would be best if you would stay in bed. **Just one of these days.**

There is no reason to feel this way. Nothing in particular happened. There was no news worse than at all the other days. There were no tasks to do worse than at all the other days. There is nothing particularly to this day. You just feel it. You feel it in your gut, in your heart, in your whole body: **This is not my day.**

So what to do? You are lying in your bed, staring at the ceiling and just wondering. And sometimes it is ok to just stay in bed a little longer. Or a lot longer. Or maybe for the whole day. If there is enough food in the house or a delivery service available, that shouldn’t be a problem. And if we are honest with each other, some days that’s just the right thing to do. Watch some tv shows, read a book, listen to music. Whatever you feel like. **Just give yourself the permission to stay put today.** To embrace the bad feeling and just go with it.

There is only a limited number of days we have. And we can decide each day how we want to feel about this day. If we want to ponder around the whole day, it’s ok. But if we choose to go out there and face the world, our mind is our most powerful weapon. I don’t say you have to pretend to be happy all the time. **No, I just want you to remember that it is your decision how you feel.** It is your responsibility to make yourself feel good. Of course, there are people and things around you that can help to lift you up, but that’s only a temporary fix. If you want to feel good, to have a good life, to enjoy your life, it all depends on you. **It is your responsibility, your decision, your life.**

Yes, some days just suck without any reason. Some days suck because of a particular reason. **But no matter what. It is your decision, and your decision alone how you handle it, how you feel, what you do about it.** Don’t get me wrong, that’s not an easy thing to do. On the contrary, it’s one of the hardest things to do to be responsible for your life. But to acknowledge this fact, to acknowledge that it is you, it is your life, it is your decision, your responsibility is the first step to own your life, to take control, to make it the life you want it to be. **And yes, it is hard work and you are going to fail along the way a lot.** But that’s ok, that’s life, that’s what makes it even more enjoyable. Just take control, accept and embrace yourself and start to enjoy the ride.
