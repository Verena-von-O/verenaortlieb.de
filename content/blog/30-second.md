Do you feel stuck sometimes? Can you watch your mood go down? Your power draining out of you like a waterfall? Getting more and more exhausted by the minute? **It’s time to move.**

Literally. Move. I don’t mean to change what you are doing; I literally mean moving your body. **One of the best ways to do so is a 30-second dance party.**

Maybe you remember this from the tv show “Grey’s Anatomy”. Maybe you’ve heard about it somewhere else. Or maybe the idea is new to you. But I can tell you it’s a fantastic way to push yourself and get happier instantly.

How to do it? **Put on some music, get up and dance.** 30 seconds are enough. Of course, you can enjoy the whole song. Or maybe one more. Or two more. However you feel, whatever you need.

**No music around?** Just sing. Sing out loud or give an excellent performance in your head. Just stand up and start moving!

**No master-dancer?** Who cares? It’s not about winning some talent show-it’s about making you happy. And if missing every beat and looking like a drunk monkey means you are happier, than that’s the way it is.

**Not alone?** Even better. I’m pretty sure the people around you need a dance party too sometimes. So why not make it a group performance. Not a good idea? Then you always can find a spot somewhere no one can see you boosting your mood. Or just sing in your head and shake your hips while getting something to drink.

So, without further ado: **Stand up and dance!!**
